# year4-2018-sample-test

the test will involve:

1. Fork Github repo
2. Create copy a new UNity project into the master branch, with the provided files in directory `Editor`
2. Create a branch containing a text file with some given content (see question 1 below)
2. Create files to pass all tests (see question 2 below)
3. Commit changes
4. Make pull request


## Question 1

Creater a branch "poem"
in that branch create a directory `words` containing a file `haiku.md` containing the following:

```
Stay the patient course. 

Of little worth is your ire. 

The network is down. 
```

commit the changes to the branch

## Question 2

(do all work on the master branch)
Create files to pass all tests.

NOTE:
- this project is a class for a serious game and deals with quiz scores (total correct / total wrong / whether test passed based on a pass percentage etc.)
- all numeric values are integers for this simple class
- there are not any exceptions, so setters with invalid values just ignore the paramater

ensdure you commit your working Unity project to master before pushing to you fork, and then making the pull request.
